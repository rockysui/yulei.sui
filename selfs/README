Introduction
============

This is a virtual machine image created by VirtualBox 4.1.12 
on Ubuntu 12.04. The operating system in the virtual machine image 
is also Ubuntu 12.04. An account named "sas14" has been created and 
its password is the name as the account name, i.e., "sas14".

System Requirements
===================

In the SPEC benchmark suite, "gcc" may cost some memory 
to analyze. We recommend you to allocate at least 16GB memory 
to the virtual machine. If you don't want to deal with "gcc", 
then 8GB memory is enough for each of the remaining 
SPEC benchmarks evaluated in our paper.

To run the virtual machine image, you need to have a VirtualBox 
(4.1.12 or newer) installed on your machine.

Quick Guidelines
================

The SELFS project is located in the "pta" directory under
the HOME directory of the user named "sas14". To run the tests
as we did for in our paper, open a terminal and do:

    cd /home/sas14/pta/     # Go to the SELFS project directory
    . ./setup.sh            # Set up environment variables
    cd sas_exp              # Go to the test directory

To reproduce our results in Figures 6 -- 8 for both SFS and SELFS
across the 14 benchmarks, execute the script "run_all.sh":

    ./run_all.sh

Please note all the results related to analysis times in our paper
are obtained on a 2.00GHz Intel Xeon 32-core CPU running Ubuntu 
Linux with 64GB memory, as described in Section 4. Obtaining all
results this way takes about 40 mins on this platform.

You can also analyze a single program, say, "ammp.orig", as follows: 

    ./run_single.sh ammp.orig

This will produce the results in Figures 6 -- 8 for "ammp.orig" under
both the analyses evaluated, SFS and SELFS.

If you want to try SFS or SELFS separately for an individual program,
say, "ammp.orig", the commends to use are:

    ./run_single.sh SFS ammp.orig       # SFS on ammp.orig
        or
    ./run_single.sh SELFS ammp.orig     # SELFS on ammp.orig


Project Layout
==============

The SELFS project is located under the "pta" directory, which resides
under the HOME directory of "sas14". The directory structure is:

    pta                     # Top directory for SELFS 
     |-Release+Asserts      # The SELFS executables
     |  |-bin
     |  |  |-wpa            # Whole-program analysis engine
     |  |-lib
     |-sas_exp
     |  |-*.orig            # Benchmarks compiled into LLVM bit-code
     |  |-*.sh, *.pl        # Scripts for running tests
     |  |-micro_benchmarks  # Small C programs
     |-setup.sh             # Script for setting up environment variables

The Benchmarks We Provide
=========================

The benchmarks used in our paper are stored under "sas_exp" directory.
There are 14 programs from both SPEC2000 and SPEC2006:

    SPEC2000: ammp, crafty, gcc, mesa, parser, perlbmk, twolf, vortex, vpr.
    SPEC2006: h264ref, hmmer, milc, sjeng, sphinx3.

We have also provided a few other benchmarks:

    SPEC2000: art, bzip2, equake, gzip, mcf
    SPEC2006: lbm, libquantum

All these programs have been compiled into the LLVM bitcode file 
format by "clang" and linked together by "llvm-link".

Some small C programs have been provided in the directory 
"/home/sas14/pta/sas_exp/micro_benchmarks/", you can compile them into
LLVM bitcode files by

    ./compile_all.sh                   # Compile all C files
        or
    ./compile_single.sh one_program.c  # Compile one C file

For each bitcode file (.opt file) generated, you can 
try to analyze it by using the script "run_single.sh" as before.

To run your own C programs, please compile them with "compile_single.sh"
as mentioned above. Then you can run SFS/SELFS with the "run_single.sh"
over the bitcode files generated. For large programs with multiple
bitcode files, please refer to
   http://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-link.html
for details on how to link several bitcode files into one.



Enjoy!
